# Real Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of over 40 rigorously written proofs demonstrating a strong theoretical foundation in Real Analysis. The topics covered span key areas of undergraduate-level analysis, including:

- **Set Theory**
- **Topology**
- **Functions and Continuity**
- **Differentiation**
- **Riemann Integration**
- **Sequences and Series**

Each proof is intended to reflect a deep understanding of underlying mathematical principles. This portfolio serves both as a personal reference and a showcase of my analytical skills.

## Structure

The proofs are organized by topic in separate directories or files for clarity. Each section focuses on core theorems, definitions, and problem-solving techniques relevant to that area.

## Purpose

This project was created as part of my advanced mathematics coursework and reflects my commitment to mathematical rigor and theoretical insight. It may be useful for:

- Students studying Real Analysis
- Instructors or TAs reviewing structured student work
- Employers or graduate programs seeking evidence of analytical and abstract reasoning skills
